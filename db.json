      "content": "The State Department plans to review the social media accounts of foreign citizens who apply for student and visiting scholar visas as it resumes processing those applications.\n\nApplicants will be screened for perceived “hostility” toward the United States, and they will be asked to make their social media accounts “public” for the review,  State Department officials said on Wednesday.\n\nAll applications for F, M and J nonimmigrant visas, which are for scholarly exchanges and research, will be reviewed, the officials said.\n\nConsular officers at missions overseas are being told to look for “any indications of hostility toward the citizens, culture, government, institutions or founding principles of the United States.” The State Department did not provide further details on how officers would define that criteria.\n\nThe agency issued the guidelines after halting the processing of student and visiting scholar visas for nearly a month.\n\nThe new policy appears to be the latest prong in the Trump administration’s broad assault on universities, which is focused on trying to tamp down liberal thought at the institutions. Some of President Trump’s aides say American universities need to embrace more conservative ideas and people.\n\nThe guidance’s vague parameters will no doubt create much uncertainty among American universities and students and scholars overseas who intend to travel to the United States.\n\nCritics say the review process and other related actions on visas by Secretary of State Marco Rubio are aimed at stifling free speech, promoting ideological conformity and coercing foreign citizens to censor themselves and refrain from criticizing the Trump administration.\n\nMany U.S. universities ask foreign students to pay full tuition, which makes up a substantial portion of the schools’ annual revenues. On some campuses, foreign students are the majority of researchers in certain disciplines, especially in the sciences.\n\nForeign students collectively pursued more than 1.3 million degrees in higher education in 2023, according to a report by the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nProfessors visiting from abroad, who are also affected by the new restrictions, often play important teaching and research roles at many American universities.\n\nA State Department spokesperson said in an email in mid-March that “all available technology” was being used to screen visa applicants and visa holders. The spokesperson was replying to a question from The New York Times about whether the department was using artificial intelligence to scan databases and social media posts to find people who, in the eyes of Trump aides, should have their visas revoked.\n\n“I think we are very worried that this is going to be some political litmus test that’s going to be applied to students,” said Sarah Spreitzer, the vice president of the American Council on Education. “I don’t believe that’s ever happened before. Obviously we’re going to see how it’s going to be applied.”\n\nMr. Rubio issued a cable on March 25 that told consular officers to scrutinize the social media content of some applicants for student and other types of visas.\n\nEditors’ Picks\n\nA Totally Spontaneous Expression of Joy, Contractually Sponsored by Moët & Chandon\n\nMarlee Matlin on Hollywood, Healing and Stories Still Untold\n\nWhy You Should Wait to Renovate\nHe sent another cable to embassies and consulates on May 27, ordering them to halt interviews  for student and visiting scholar visas until State Department headquarters could come up with new guidelines for reviewing applicants’ social media accounts.\n\nMr. Rubio has also said that the State Department would target visas held by Chinese students. He announced on May 28 that the Trump administration would work to “aggressively revoke” visas of Chinese students, including those with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or who are studying in “critical fields.” He and the department have given no further details.\n\nSeparately, the Trump administration tried this spring to end foreign student enrollment at Harvard University as part of its attack on that school. The State Department stopped processing visas for foreign students, scholars and other foreign visitors planning to go to Harvard, but the agency told overseas missions on June 9 to resume the processing after a judge prohibited the administration from adopting the ban.\n\nIn recent months, Mr. Rubio has spoken about canceling various student visas, revoking permanent residency status (“green cards”) and scrutinizing the social media history of foreign visitors, often in the context of outrage around Israel’s war campaign in Gaza. He has said pro-Palestinian protesters on campuses have harassed other students, destroyed property and disrupted daily life, even though those acts have not been widespread across university protests.\n\nMr. Rubio told reporters in late March that he had revoked 300 or more visas, many of which were issued to students, and was continuing to cancel more daily.\n\nIn early March, Mr. Rubio stripped permanent residency status from Mahmoud Khalil, a recent graduate of Columbia University who had been a student activist. Mr. Rubio said Mr. Khalil, who has Palestinian heritage and is married to an American citizen, was undermining U.S. foreign policy. Immigration agents then arrested Mr. Khalil.\n\nIn some cases, the foreign citizens at risk of losing their visas or green cards have brought cases against the U.S. government, and judges have issued temporary restraining orders on federal actions.\n\nStephanie Saul contributed reporting from New York.",

      "content": "Kenya has reaffirmed its digital prowess by bagging four top prizes at the Huawei Information Communication and Technology (ICT) Competition Global Final 2024–2025 held in Shenzhen, China.\n\nThe awards, which showcased the country’s growing strength in ICT education and innovation, were won by 12 public university students who competed against some of the most talented learners from around the world.\n\nHuawei Kenya Deputy Chief Executive Officer Stephen Zhang said the competition offered students a platform to showcase their skills in areas such as Artificial Intelligence, Cloud, and Networking.\n\nHe noted that Kenyan students have consistently excelled on the global stage, and the latest wins are proof of the country’s readiness to lead and compete in the international digital space.\n\nAmong the awards secured during the global finals was a first prize in the Computing Track by a team made up of students from Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT) and Machakos University.\n\n Another combined team from Machakos University, JKUAT, and the University of Nairobi won second place in the Network Track.\n\nA joint team from JKUAT and Moi University took second place in the Cloud Track category, while the Silicon Savannah team from Egerton University walked away with third place in the Innovation Track.\n\nZhang explained that Kenya’s participation in the competition was part of a broader national strategy to strengthen digital skills and close the gap between academia and the job market.\n\nSpeaking at Parliament Buildings in Nairobi, where National Assembly Speaker Moses Wetang’ula hosted the winning team, Zhang stressed that digital transformation is rapidly reshaping industries across the world.\n\nHe pointed out that the biggest challenge amid this shift is the shortage of skilled ICT professionals. He said initiatives like the global competition and the Huawei ICT Academy are helping to empower the next generation of innovators, ensuring that talent development keeps pace with technological advancement.\n\nZhang also revealed that Kenya had fielded an all-girls team in China this year—a significant step forward in promoting gender inclusion in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics.\nSpeaker Wetang’ula led a recognition ceremony organised by Huawei Kenya in collaboration with public universities and government partners to honour the 12 students for their exemplary performance on the global stage.\n\nHe congratulated the learners and urged them to keep striving for excellence in ICT and to use their skills to develop solutions that can make a real impact both in Kenya and globally.\n\n“Keep on pushing forward and leverage emerging fields to create practical solutions for Kenya and the world,” Wetang’ula advised.\n\nOne of the winners, Mark Omaiko, a second-year student of Cloud Computing and Information Security at Machakos University, said the entire team was proud to have placed Kenya on the global map as an ICT powerhouse. He encouraged other students to take advantage of similar programs to test their skills, gain international exposure, and proudly represent the country.",

      "content": "Iran has said it will not resume talks over its nuclear programme while under attack, hours after Israel's defence minister warned of a \"prolonged\" conflict with the Islamic Republic.\n\nForeign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Friday met European diplomats in Geneva who urged him to revive diplomatic efforts with the US over his country's nuclear programme.\n\nThe Israeli army's chief of staff Eyal Zamir said in a video address that his country should be ready for a \"prolonged campaign\".\n\nFighting has raged into the night with the Israeli military announcing a new wave of attacks against Iranian missile storage and launch sites after Iran launched missiles towards central Israel.\n\nExplosions were heard close to Tel Aviv, with missile interceptions visible over Israel's second-largest city. Reports say a building was set on fire in central Israel by falling shrapnel.\n\nMeanwhile, a 16-year-old was killed and two others were injured in a Israeli strike on the city of Qom, south of Tehran, Iranian state media reported early on Saturday.\n\nThey reported Israeli strikes also again targeted a nuclear facility in the city of Isfahan.\n\nLive coverage\nOn Friday, Araghchi said Iran was ready to consider diplomacy only once Israel's \"aggression is stopped\".\n\nIran's nuclear programme was peaceful, he insisted, and Israel's attacks violated international law. Iran, he added, would continue to \"exercise its legitimate right of self-defence\".\n\n\"I make it crystal clear that Iran's defence capabilities are non-negotiable,\" he said.\n\nAraghchi is set to attend another round of talks on Saturday, in Istanbul, with representatives of the Arab League over the weekend.\n\nIsrael's ambassador to the UN accused Iran of having a \"genocidal agenda\" and posing an ongoing threat, adding that Israel would not stop targeting nuclear facilities until they were \"dismantled\".\n\nIn an interview with German newspaper Bild published on Saturday, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar said his country had set back Iran's nuclear capabilities by at least two years.\n\nHe added that strikes would continue.\nUS President Donald Trump said Iran had a \"maximum\" of two weeks to avoid possible American air strikes, suggesting that he could take a decision before the 14-day deadline he set on Thursday.\n\n\"I'm giving them a period of time, and I would say two weeks would be the maximum,\" Trump told reporters.\n\nThe aim, he said, was to \"see whether or not people come to their senses\".\n\nThe US president was also dismissive of the Geneva talks between Araghchi and foreign ministers from the UK, France, Germany and the EU.\n\n\"Iran doesn't want to speak to Europe,\" Trump said. \"They want to speak to us. Europe is not going to be able to help in this.\"\n\nUK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said that the US had provided a \"short window of time\" to resolve the crisis in the Middle East which was \"perilous and deadly serious\".\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said the ministers had invited the Iranian minister to \"consider negotiations with all sides, including the United States, without awaiting the cessation of strikes\".\n\nBarrot added that there could be \"no definitive solution through military means to the Iran nuclear problem\" and warned that it was \"dangerous to want to impose a regime change\" in Iran.\n\nIsrael was also hit by a new round of Iranian strikes on Friday with the Israeli military reporting an attack of 20 missiles targeting Haifa.\n\nOne Israeli woman died of a heart attack, bringing the Israeli death toll since the conflict began to 25.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces said they had attacked ballistic missile storage and launch sites in western Iran.\n\nOver the past week, Israeli air strikes have destroyed Iranian military facilities and weapons, and killed senior military commanders and nuclear scientists.\n\nIran's health ministry said on Sunday that at least 224 people had been killed, while a human rights group, the Human Rights Activists News Agency, put the unofficial death toll at 657 on Friday.\n\nIsrael launched strikes in Iran on 13 June, leading to several rounds of Iranian missile and drone attacks on Israel.",
